Supervised Learning - Classification

We have two supervised learning algorithms for classification:
1) Naive Bayes:
   This is a probabilistic algorithm where we calculate the prior probability of a data point to be contained in each classifiers. Then we label each datapoint by the class which it has more probability to lie in.
  
2) K-Nearest Neighbours:
    In this method, we are given a variable k using which for any incoming data point we calculate it's k nearest datapoints. To calculate distance we use euclidien distance. In these k nearest datapoint, then we find most common class and label the data point as a part of that class.
